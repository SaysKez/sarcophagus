# What's That Scratching at Your Sarcophagus?
*A micro game of interactive fiction and an undead pharaoh by Kezie Todd*

Play as a ghostly pharaoh awakened from your royal slumber by a tomb robber. Unable to interact directly with this vile desecrator of your sanctuary, you must experiment with weird and wacky items and traps to instil fear in the heart of the intruder.
